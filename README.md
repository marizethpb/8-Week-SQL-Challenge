# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

### About the challenge
This is the famous [8-week SQL challenge by Danny Ma](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). The challenge focuses on solving business questions on various industries through writing Postgres SQL code. 

### Why this Challenge
I did this challenge because I heard great things about it and I want to learn what business questions to focus on depending the problem and industry given. I am also happy that I did this challenge because the source on generating the sample database is publicized and I appreciate that I can see the database generation.
